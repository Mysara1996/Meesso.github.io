> Hunt smarter. Report better. Fix faster.

Hi, I’m **Maysara 3nnani** — a SOC analyst turned Red Teamer, **CTF player (HTB/THM)**, and **bug hunter**.  
I love turning noisy telemetry into clear findings and fix-first reports. When I’m not threat hunting, I’m building my security brand **MEESSO** and writing narrative posts that teach by story.

## What I’m building — **MEESSO**
- **AI-SOC patterns**: agentic workflows to cut **MTTT** and speed up triage
- **Hunt packs**: Sigma + queries mapped to ATT&CK with clear validation steps
- **Report templates**: fix-first, reproducible, action-oriented  
- **Write-ups**: narrative style posts that turn cases into teaching moments

After the rush of acquiring a forensic image — that precious snapshot of a system frozen in time — comes the quiet, deliberate phase of opening it up for analysis.

But before you can dive in, there’s one critical step: **mounting**.

Think of mounting as giving life to the captured evidence. When you mount a forensic image, you’re essentially placing it in a usable state — making it behave as if it were a real, connected drive.

Remember the last time you plugged in a USB flash drive? Your operating system instantly assigned it a drive letter, and suddenly its contents were at your fingertips. That’s exactly what happens when you mount a forensic image — except now, your “USB” is an entire disk from a compromised system, preserved bit by bit for investigation.

Once mounted, the fun begins. You can:

- Run antivirus scans to check for known malware signatures.
- Copy out specific files for deeper examination.
- Browse system logs, user documents, and browser histories.
- Analyze artifacts to reconstruct what really happened.

In short — **mounting transforms static evidence into a living environment for analysis**.

### 🧰 Arsenal Image Mounter — The Investigator’s Swiss Army Knife

One of the most versatile tools for mounting images is **Arsenal Image Mounter (AIM)**. It supports a wide range of image formats — from raw `.dd` dumps to `E01`, `AFF4`, and even virtual machine disks like `VMDK`, `VDI`, and `OVA`.

![AIM main interface]({{ '/assets/img/mounting-forensic-images/aim-ui.png' | relative_url }}){: width="1000" }

![AIM supported formats]({{ '/assets/img/mounting-forensic-images/aim-supported-formats.png' | relative_url }}){: width="1000" }

But what truly makes it shine is its **mounting modes**.

Among them, **Write Temporary mode** stands out as a favorite for forensic analysts. It’s like working on a copy of your evidence with a magical undo button. You can interact with the image freely — extract files, open logs, or run forensic utilities — without fear of altering the original data.

Any change, whether intentional or accidentyal, can be instantly reverted. Think of it as creating a **snapshot** of the image at the moment you begin — one you can always roll back to once your analysis is done.

> **Tip:** For volatile experiments (AV scans, parsers that may write temp files), use AIM’s *Write Temporary* mode. For strict read-only viewing, keep the default.

### 🧩 Compatibility Matters

Before you start mounting, always check the filesystem compatibility.

- Windows doesn’t natively read `ext4`, `xfs`, etc.
- macOS won’t natively write to `NTFS` (and read support can be limited).
- For Linux filesystems on Windows, consider a Linux VM/WSL and loop mounts.

Skipping this step often leads to frustration — or worse, wasted time troubleshooting what seems like a “broken” image.

### 🧭 Other Tools in the Investigator’s Toolkit

While Arsenal Image Mounter is a go-to for many, **FTK Imager** remains another excellent choice. It’s lightweight, reliable, and supports mounting images directly for preview or analysis.

Ultimately, the right tool depends on your workflow. What matters most is understanding **why** mounting is such a crucial step: it bridges the gap between acquisition and analysis, letting you explore evidence safely and efficiently.

### 🧠 Final Thoughts

Mounting a forensic image isn’t just a technical procedure — it’s the moment your evidence speaks.

With tools like **Arsenal Image Mounter** or **FTK Imager**, you can safely bring that data to life, explore its contents, and uncover the story hidden within every byte.

In digital forensics, every detail matters — and mounting is where the story begins.
